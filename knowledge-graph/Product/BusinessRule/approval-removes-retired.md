# Approval removes retired entities

A retirement is a Harness/Plan with a `retires` reference to each entity it retires. The retired files stay on the plan's branch, so every reference resolves and the consistency guard accepts it.

- Approving the plan removes each `retires` target from the main line, whether or not the branch still has it
- Retention and chat write retirements this way
